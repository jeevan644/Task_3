This project focuses on implementing both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models using Python, leveraging libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The objective is to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. By training a model on historical housing data, we aim to understand the relationship between different variables and the price of a house.

Initially, we perform Simple Linear Regression using only the area as the independent feature to predict the price. The model is trained and evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the R-squared (R²) score. A scatter plot with the fitted regression line is generated to visually interpret the results.

Subsequently, we extend the model to Multiple Linear Regression by including additional features. This allows the model to capture more complex relationships in the data. Although visualizing multiple dimensions is challenging, model evaluation is again conducted using MAE, MSE, and R².

This project highlights the complete pipeline of loading data, preprocessing, training, evaluating, and interpreting linear models. It builds foundational skills crucial for predictive analytics and machine learning. The insights gained from the coefficients help in understanding how each feature impacts the target variable.
